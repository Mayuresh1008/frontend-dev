        <h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
        <h3>Learning HTML, CSS</h3>
        
        <p>I'm currently on a 90-day journey to master frontend development.
            This is my first basic portfolio homepage - built with only HTML.
            I'm excited to build real websites and become a pro developer!
        </p>

        <p> In this project, I'm learning HTML structure, tags, headings, paragraphs, and more - step by step.</p>
